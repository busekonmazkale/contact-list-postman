In this project, I learned how to manage API requests using Postman. I practiced sending both positive and negative requests to understand how the API responds in different scenarios. Additionally, I learned how to run tests in Postman to validate responses, check status codes, and ensure that the API behaves as expected. This helped me gain practical experience in API testing and request management.
